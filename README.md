# Frontend Mentor - QR code component challenge

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

That's my result from the first challenge of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

The challenge was to make a qr code card. I made using only html and css with flexbox.

You can check the result on [my page](https://duroteus.github.io/qrcode-challenge/).
